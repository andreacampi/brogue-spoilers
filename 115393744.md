walkthrough
===========

  * D1: autopilot, trigger pressure plate to get key, get and equip regen ring, equip spear and scale mail, drop leather.
  * D2: autopilot with caution (don't let the eel get you, also the bloat). Drop green potions (hallucination)
  * D3: explore, drink the strength potions (yellow). Trigger pressure plate and get ???
  * D4: kill the jelly just north. Find secret door to go down.
  * D5: ignore the goblins room top-left (or kill it with caustic gas (aquamarine) for fun and walk away). Read enchantment if you haven't yet. Eat food. Equip chain mail and drop scale. Careful if the toad gets you, you may encounter a pack of jackals.
  * D6: autopilot, make sure you pick up the life potion and scroll of enchanting (use it). Drop the war axe.
  * D7: carefully kill the 2 eels (firebolt). Search for traps in the room at the bottom. Use firebolt again in the goblin room top right of the screen. Use one more enchanting. You can use caustic gas on the monkeys, don't burn just in case. Pay attention to the centipede--don't burn it in the far room, there's a scroll there.
  * D8: bring the pink jelly and each dar up to D7. Kill the black jelly, taking advantage of the net trap, but avoid the paralysis trap in the room just before. Kill the ogre top left, get and equip the axe. Get a ring north east (probably wisdom), negate the mirror north to get the armor. Don't bother dealing with the guardian south west to get the key, the drop is not worth it. Do get the teleportation charm.
  * D9: look for traps everywhere. Careful burning stuff as both protect scroll are here.
  * D10: beware the acid turret in a room at the bottom of the screen, although by now you should be protected. There is nothing particularly good in the room north, but it might have a dar + a spider so you may want to avoid.
  * D11: try to fight ogre, troll and wraiths separately. There's a secret door up north, make sure you get the potion of life. Ignore the bad ring (aquamarine).
  * D12: beware the phantom in the second room (using telepathy should make it manageable). Not sure what the deal is with the spark sentinels.
  * D13: possibly 2 zombies. Fire trap where the prisoners are! Also be super careful with the negation spell (still unidentified), it will kill the golem. Invisibility charm might be good.
  * D14: there are traps in the middle of the screen that can easily be triggered, especially by a zombie on fire. Be super careful, try to draw it away and keep your teleport ready. North east has a bloodwort, your allies might need it.
  * D15: potions among the sentinels may or may not be useful (life, speed, invisibility). There is a scroll of enchantment north east, in the grass, with a fire turret; blink and it's burned up.
  * D16: don't burn your first scroll of identify
  * D17: imps are a pain here
  * D18: you can meet phantoms and potentially revenant. There is a group of dars east that can be hard to tackle at once.
  * D20: life, identify
  * D21: ignore the sentinels up north, they protect a -2 weapon. Not much of value in general.
  * D22: watch out for a tentacle horror. A scroll will burn west. Not much else.
  * D23: grab food
  * D24: tentacle horror ally, potions of life and strength, food. Take your time
