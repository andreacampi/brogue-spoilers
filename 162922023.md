walkthrough
===========

  * D1: grab the key, take the whip from the vault, then autopilot.
  * D2: enchant (nurtflin porta) the whip twice, then equip it and protect it (flem nuglonidge); drink strength (blue) and wear the chain mail. Drop hallucination (mauve)
  * D3: drop gerd blotogana scrolls (aggravate monsters)
  * D4: clear out the level, then use the haste charm to get the key and run away
  * D5: ignore the mace
  * D6: drop the splint mail. There's a whole secret section west.
  * D7: beware the bog monster. Burn the two ogres, there's nothing that can burn. Secret door south west.
  * D8: beware paralysis in the middle, there may be multiple. Drop the black potion (caustic gas) if you must.
  * D9:
  * D10: beware the eel in the pond near the zombie; fighting both at the same time is dangerous. There's also a troll that may be dangerous if you have other enemies; haste yourself and draw them elsewhere. Ignore banded mail.
  * D11: ignore the chain and banded mail, as well as the jasper ring. The weapons (mace and axe) are uninteresting too.
  * D12: not sure what to make of the room with sentinels
  * D13: ignore the plate armor. This level has 3 scrolls of enchanting. There's also a useless scroll in the room north east so don't worry aabout blowing it up.
  * D14: there's a secret door north-nort east
