walkthrough
===========

  * D1: autoexplore, drink the two potions of strength (burgundy). Drop the broadsword.
  * D2: auto, free the monkey. Drop creeping death (aquamarine).
  * D3: auto, free the goblin. Ignore the war pike. Look for a secret door north east, it contains the leather armor. Wear it, drop the old leather and the banded. Read protect armor. Drop creeping deatch (aquamarine).
  * D4: avoid the pond, you can easily walk around it.
  * D5: take the whip and enchant it. Carefully take the key, you will have to soldier through, there's no trick. Pick an ally. Drop the broadsword.
  * D6: ignore the room south east with the acid blob, it's not worth it. Drop the split mail and aggravate monsters.
  * D7: beware the bog monster in the swamp; telepathy can help, and hopefully you still have a potion of life. There's a secret door due west, it has the ring of reaping.
  * D8: secret door due east
  * D9: beware hidden pits. There's an orb that gives you a phoenix ally.
  * D10: beware hidden pits, as well as a alarm trap.
  * D11: beware pits again. There's also a secret door north west.
  * D12: read protect weapon (there are still a lot of acid blobs around). Drop the war axe.
  * D13: there are two salamanders guarding a naga. The room just before it has explosive gas but nothing that will burn, you can use it.
  * D14
  * D15: drop scale mail. Commutation altar.
